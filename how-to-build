required packages:
  pkgconf sdl2 sdl2_net zlib python3 python-pillow

LINUX:
run
  CC=gcc make all
binary should be placed at build/b173c
(why explicitly set CC? i dont know but for me it defaults to cc for some reason, gotta figure it out later)

LINUX TO WINDOWS:
run
  CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc make all
binary should be placed at build/b173c.exe
run
  x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip b173c.exe
so it takes up 3mbs instead of 20

WINDOWS:
idk figure it out yourself

warning: running this on windows natively results in shit performance???
might be because of the amd drivers? someone with nvidia please test
